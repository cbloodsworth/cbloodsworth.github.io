## What is PearTerm?
<img src="../../../pearterm.png" style="border-radius: 10px;"></img>

**PearTerm** is a terminal emulator written from scratch, using Typescript.

I initially started it as a portfolio site to show off some of my work 
(with a terminal-style twist), but it evolved into a full-on unix-style 
shell interface. I mainly wanted to build a system that looks and feels
like a unix terminal from the ground up. 

Nowhere in this project is an existing terminal being called or accessed in any 
way -- all logic is built in-house. I'm using this mainly as a learning 
exercise to see how these types of systems are typically built, and it's given
me a better appreciation for terminals, shells and unix systems in general.
