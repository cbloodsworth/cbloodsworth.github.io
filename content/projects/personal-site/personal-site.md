# About this website

Back in 2021 or so, I had [thrown together a portfolio website](https://github.com/cbloodsworth/old.cbloodsworth.github.io) 
as a way to display some of the projects I was working on.

There were some issues with it, and it certainly wasn't mobile friendly, but it served as a
pretty good starting point. Unfortunately, I never actually got around to implementing any
of the additional functionality, and it ended up just sitting as a single `html` file served
through GitHub pages.

So, four years later, I decided to give the site a revamp. You can actually see much of the
old portfolio in the [projects](..) tab of this site, but there are also a number of new
pages. More than one `html` file this time!
